# LoRa Remote Relay
[‚ÜêTop](../README.md)<BR>
When LoRa is enabled on the station by adding the LoRa Module and configuring CONFIG.TXT on the SD card. LoRa messages from remote LoRa stations are received and stored in memory. Up to 64 messages. At the next transmit windows these observations are sent to Particle. They will be added to the N2S file when necessary.

For information on LoRa Remote stations see [3D-PAWS-Feather-LoRaRemoteM0](https://github.com/3d-paws/3D-PAWS-Feather-LoRa-Remote) code base.

### LoRa message type received for relay are:

- "INFO" : Sent at boot providing station configuration information
- "LR" : LoRa Relay message containing observation information.

These type are sent to Particle as event types "INFO" and "LR". Where Particle Integrations (Webhooks) take over the processsing.

### Tibits of Information:
- LoRa messages are AES 128 bit encrypted.
- LoRa messages are in JSON format
- The Remote Lora device messages will include a device id (devid) and a CHORDS station id (id). 

### LoRa Module
For the Full Station to receive LoRa messages a LoRa Module needs to be added.
