# Muon Board Support
[‚Üê](../README.md)<BR>

Particle Muon Datasheet https://docs.particle.io/reference/datasheets/m-series/muon-datasheet

Requires a SD Card to be connected to GPIO pins

### WIFI Support
To Enable Muon WiFi

At the top level of the SD card make a file called WIFI.TXT
Add one line to the file
This line has 3 items that are comma separated Example
 
 MUON,ssid,password
 
 MUON is a keyword to distinguish the file from a Argon WIFI.TXT file.

 If WIFI.TXT is removed, cellular is enabled.

### Muon Compiling
In library.properties uncomment
#dependencies.particle-som-gnss=1.0.0

Copy lib-muonparticle-som-gnss to lib directory


### Caveats
* Muon can not support Tinovi Leaf Wetness sensor. I2C 0x61 conflicts with KG200Z LoRaWAN radio. Removed from Muon * compile.
* Muon can not support HTU21DF sensor. I2C 0x40 conflicts with the on board fuel gauge chip. Removed from Muon compile.
* Muon wind direction requires a AS5600L sensor. The AS5600 version has same I2C address (0x36) as the on board cipher chip.
* Muon has a on board temperature sensor that will be reported as ptms (Particle Muon Temperature Sensor)
