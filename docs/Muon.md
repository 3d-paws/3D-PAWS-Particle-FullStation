## SD Card Requirement
A microSD card must be connected to the GPIO pins for certain functionality.

---

## Wi-Fi Support

To enable Muon Wi-Fi:  

At the **top level of the SD card**, create a file named `WIFI.TXT`.  
Add one line with three comma-separated items:  

MUON,ssid,password

- The keyword `MUON` distinguishes this from an Argon `WIFI.TXT` file.  
- If the `WIFI.TXT` file is removed, cellular connectivity is enabled instead.

---

## Muon Compiling

- In `library.properties`, uncomment the line:  
  #dependencies.particle-som-gnss=1.0.0  
- Copy the `lib-muonparticle-som-gnss` folder to the `lib` directory.

---

## Caveats

- Muon cannot support the Tinovi Leaf Wetness sensor due to I2C address (0x61) conflict with the KG200Z LoRaWAN radio. The sensor is removed from the Muon compile.  
- Muon cannot support the HTU21DF sensor due to I2C address (0x40) conflict with the onboard fuel gauge chip. It is removed from Muon compile.  
- Muon wind direction requires an AS5600L sensor. The AS5600 version shares the same I2C address (0x36) as the onboard cipher chip.  
- Muon includes an onboard temperature sensor reported as ptms (Particle Muon Temperature Sensor).

## GPS / Global Navigation Satellite System Support

The GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) library (particle-som-gnss v1.0.0) is designed for Particle cellular modems with built-in GNSS support, including the M-SOM platform. It provides a simple interface for accessing GNSS data on Particle devices. The library is accessed in code via location.h. Source at https://github.com/particle-iot/particle-som-gnss.

The GPS functionality on the Particle Muon continues to work even if cellular is turned off, as the GNSS module operates independently from the cellular modem. Communication is via UART (Serial2 on pins D24/D25).

Location information is included in the INFO feature output as:  
lat, lon, alt (altitude), sat (satellites in use)

Obtaining location information may take some time, with a timeout set at 90 seconds.
