# Air Quality Station Option and Operation
[‚ÜêTop](../README.md)<BR>

### Air Quality Station
You can change the operating behavior of the Full Station to become a dedicated Air Quality Station (AQS). Use the Plantower PMSA003I sensor. 
When set as a AQS:
- Wind, Rain and other OP[1,2] sensors are disabled. Files OP1DIST.TXT, OP1RAIN.TXT, OP1RAW.TXT, OP2RAW.TXT are ignored.
- One minute observations becomes 5 minutes (default), 10 or 15. With matching reporting periods.
- OP2 Pin is wired to SET pin on the air quality sensor. The SET pin on the air quality sensor, when low, puts the sensor into sleep mode. \
  Sleep mode on the air quality sensor is a feature that allows the sensor to enter a low-power state to conserve energy and extend the lifetime of the laser and fan components. \
  This reduces wear on moving parts, especially the fan and laser. Both of which have a finite lifespan (laser is about 8000 hours).

#### Taking Air Quality Observations
- The air quality sensor is turn on (via OP2 Pin) 45 seconds prior to the time we need to make the observation.
- After 35 seconds (required for warm-up and stabilization) a reading is taken. This is discarded (clears any stale or buffered data).
- Then 800ms later, 11 readings are taken 800ms a part.
- Then sensor is then put to sleep.
- From the 11 readings, if there are more failed readings than good, -999 is reported for the sensor readings. \
  Otherwise an average is returned from the good samples taken.

#### Enabling/Disabling Air Quality Station Option
- Create/Delete file OPTAQS.TXT on the SD card.
- You can also use the Particle Console to send Do Actions.\
  OPTAQS - Air Quality Station configuration (OPTAQS.TXT) (Requires REBOOT after setting) \
  OPTFS - Full Station configuration (Removes OPTAQS.TXT) (Requires REBOOT after setting)

#### Caveats
- Other I2C sensors from the Full Station are supported.
- The air quality sensor should be connected to the 5v pin and not the 3.3v. \
  Not doing so put a strain on the on board 3.3v voltage regulator.
