### Collecting Wind Data
Wind_SampleSpeed() - Return a wind speed based on how many interrupts and duration between calls to this function.
Wind_SampleDirection() - Talk i2c to the AS5600 sensor and get direction.
Wind_TakeReading() - Call this function every second. It calls wind direction and wind speed functions. Then saves samples in a circular buffer of 60 buckets.

### Creating the Wind Observations
Wind_DirectionVector() - Uses the 60 sample buckets of wind direction where wind speed is greater than zero to compute and return a wind vector.
Wind_SpeedAverage() - Uses the 60 sample buckets of wind speed to return a wind speed average.
Wind_GustUpdate() - Uses the most current highest 3 consecutive samples of wind speed from the 60 samples. The 3 samples are then averaged for wind gust.
Variables wind.gust and wind.gust_directionare set by this function.
Call this function before calling Wind_Gust() and Wind_GustDirection().
Wind_Gust() - Returns wind.gust
Wind_GustDirection() - Returns wind.gust_direction
